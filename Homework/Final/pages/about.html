            <p>
                <span>My name is Edward (Seonwoo) Jeong, and I am currently a senior at New York University, majoring in Integrated Design and Media (IDM).</span>
                <span>I started my college career in Civil Engineering but switched to Integrated Design and Media (IDM) after two and a half years.</span>
                <span>Furthermore, I served in the Korean army where I held positions as a squad-leader and a unit supply sergeant.</span>
                <span>During my service, I successfully utilized the Formation Resources Management System and effectively communicated with my team.</span>
                <span>Drawing from my diverse educational background and military experience, I am deeply passionate about exploring the convergence between Civil Engineering and IDM.</span>
                <span>My goal is to leverage this unique intersection in my future endeavors and to make a global impact in my field.</span>
