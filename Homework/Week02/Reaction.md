### Five Important Considerations for Wireframing

- The article from The Media Temple Blog talks about how important wireframing is for designing websites or apps. It says before you start making designs, you should really understand the problem you're trying to solve by asking lots of questions. Then, drawing your ideas early helps figure out the best way to build something that works well. It's also good to show these drawings to other people on your team to get their thoughts and make sure your plan is doable. Knowing how to use design tools well can save you time, so you can focus on making great designs. Lastly, it's important to make your designs easy for your team to understand, whether they need lots of detail or just the basics. The main point is to not rush into designing without planning first, because wireframing helps you share ideas and make better designs.
