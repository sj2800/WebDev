                Hi! My name is Edward (Seonwoo) Jeong, and I am currently 
                a senior at New York University, majoring in Integrated Design 
                and Media (IDM). I started my college career in Civil Engineering 
                but switched to Integrated Design and Media (IDM) after two and a 
                half years and I also have experience serving in the Korean army 
                where I held positions as a squad-leader and a unit supply sergeant. 
                Drawing from my diverse educational background and military experience, 
                I am passionate about exploring the convergence between Civil Engineering 
                and IDM.
            </p>
