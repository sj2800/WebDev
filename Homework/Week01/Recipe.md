### Instructions

1. **Cook the ground pork, or bacon**

    Add 1/2 pound of ground pork, or 3 slices of chopped bacon to a large skillet, or wok, over medium high heat on the stove. Cook the pork for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pork from the skillet and set it aside in a bowl.

2. **Cook the mushrooms**

   Add sliced shiitake mushrooms to the grease in the pan left from the ground pork, or bacon. Add soy sauce and stir everything together. Allow the mushrooms to cook in the pan for 5 minutes, without stirring.

3. **Add garlic and ginger**

    After 5 minutes, add minced garlic and ginger paste to the mushrooms in the pan. Stir everything together and cook for 1-2 minutes.

4. **Make the broth**

    Add toasted sesame oil, white miso paste, chili garlic sauce and chicken broth to the pan. Turn the heat on the stove up to high and bring the broth to a boil.
    
5. **Add the noodles** 

    Once the broth is simmering on the stove, add the ramen noodles and cook for 3 minutes, using a spoon, or spatula, to separate the noodles as they cook in the broth.

6. **Add the spinach and pork** 

     Add the cooked pork back to the pan, along with the spinach. Stir to combine all ingredients and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes before serving the ramen soup in bowls and adding the toppings of your choice.
